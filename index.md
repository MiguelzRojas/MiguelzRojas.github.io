# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Miguel Rojas and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is electrical engineering.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

   Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was my introduction to coding. Before this lab I had zero experience with coding.What this lab basically taught us was the basics of how to move our repositories and how to maneuver in github. I also enjoy looking back at how much my partner and I struggled on the basics of this class compared to the most recent lab.

* Lab 3

   Lab 3 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it shows how useful coding can be in many different ways. Something as simple as the unit price of a pizza can be quickly calculated by using the code we constructed. That can be useful for business so they can accurately estimate the cost of their product.

* Lab 6

   Lab 6 part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it dealt with math functions and math is one of my favorite subjects. In addition, it showed me that even in the engineering field that I am going to, coding is still useful for making calculations. It motivated me to want to learn more about coding since it will be useful in my career.
